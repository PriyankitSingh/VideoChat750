# VideoChat750
Web based video conferencing with graceful degradation in low bandwidth. In this project, we explored ways of 
keeping a sense of presence in low bandwidth, where a video link cannot be sustained. The program stops the video stream
and starts sending images of the user's face when the bandwidth drops below a certain threshold. The user's face is trasked
using a face tracking library  and multiple faces are supported.

The project has been hosted on the following link so you don't have to set up a server to test any functionality.

To use the application to call your friends, simply log in using facebook and click the name of your facebook friend who you want to call.
Note that only the friends who have signed into the application once will show up in the friends list because of Facebook privacy policy.
You can also type a name and login using that id. You can call people by typing their id bet this system is not recommended as you have to know the exact name of the other person but this can be used for testing.
